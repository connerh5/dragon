*Motivation, reason for creating, and general info.*
1. This dragon text game is a solo adventure in a sci-fi medieval time setting inspired by skyrim.
2. It's very simple to play and progress, once you run the code just type your input out 
3. It's extremely easy to die and even more unpredictable so youll probably need to play a few times to complete it.
4. A very simple and easy to use project, it does not solve any issues, it's just for pure entertainment.
5. It is also made through python, and one of my first projects, specifically one to help me learn classes and attributes.




***Install or copy code through any python editor***

Enjoy!
